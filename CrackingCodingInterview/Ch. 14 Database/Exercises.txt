	What is Normal form?
		1)1st Normal Form
			*no multi-value columns
			*attribute domains should not change
				-column types don't change
			*column names are unique
				-a table will not have columns with same names
			*Order doesn't matter
		2)2nd Normal Form
			*already in 1st normal form
			*No partial depedency
				-a column depends on all primary keys in the table not just parts of primary keys
				-remove partial depedency by removing attributes causing partial depedency to another table
		3)3rd Normal Form
			*already in 2nd normal form
			*No transitive depedency
				-if column a depends on column b and column b depends on column c
					then break into 2 tables where table 1 is a & b and table 2 is b & c
